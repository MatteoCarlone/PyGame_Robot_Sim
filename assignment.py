	Function to detect the closest golden box to the robot in a cone which by default is 90 degrees (between -45 and 45 degrees) in a maximum distance of 0.8.
	The main purpose here is to have a threshold to stop the robot and avoid walls.
	
	Arguments:
	
		distance = the settable distance of the cone in which the robot can detect golden boxes (by deafault 0.8)
		
		angle = the settable angle of the cone in which the robot can detect golden boxes (by default 45)

	Function to detect the closest silver token to the robot in a cone in 40 degrees (between -20 and 20 degrees) at a maximum distance of 4. 
	
	Furthermore, thanks to the gold_in_between() function, the robot ignores the tokens silver behind the walls or that have obstacles that precede them.
	
	The main purpose here is to recognise tokens silver to approach.

def gold_in_between(dist, rot_y):

		dist = the distnace of the current silver token that the robot has seen 
		
		rot_y = the angle in degrees of the current silver token that the robot has seen
		
	Returns:

	This Function approach the silver token when the robot detect one. At first The robot will verify if it is in the right direction of the silver token and, if it's not, it will adjust itself turning right and left. Secondly it will call the function Routine().
	
	Arguments:

	The robot will rotate towards the furthest golden box until it no longer sees any golden box in cone of 91 degrees at a distance of 1 in front of it. 
	
	The angle and the distance of the cone are settable by passing the arguments to the function find_golden_token(..,..).
	
	Thanks to this feature the robot will always turn counter-clockwise.
